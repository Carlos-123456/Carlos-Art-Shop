            <p style="color: black;">Mark Carlos M. Oliquino, a 21-year-old third-year student at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Lopez, Quezon Branch,  who is taking a Bachelor of Science and information technology.
            
                <p style="color: black;">He became interested in  from a young age due to the influence of his brother's friend who was good in the field of art. He is the representative of the school whenever there is an art contest. Seeing the artworks being made, Carlos was amazed while watching them make art and he tried to do it too. Every vacation, he, his sister and his cousin like to draw pictures in books such as animals and the environment and they show it to their parents who's more beautiful. He also likes to watch cartoons and anime so he draws his favorite characters. In school, he brought his passion for drawing until he was part of art contests from elementary school to high school, winning too, but what was important to him was that when he lost, he used it to improve even more. seeing artwork with others is the best teacher for him in art because from them he learns more techniques resulting in the development of his art. He wishes to be able to teach what he knows about art.</p>
